    (a)
        *NRU (Not Recently Used) algorithm:
            Have two status bit: R-->page is referenced(1) or not(0) , M-->page is modified(1) or not(0).
            According to the status bit,OS divides page fault into four categories:
                Class 0:not referenced,not modified
                Class 1:not referenced,modified
                CLass 2:referenced,not modified
                Class 3:referenced,modified
            NRU algorithm removes a page at random from the lowest numbered nonempty class.
        
        -->Page 0 will be replace because of the lowest class(Class 0 due to R=0 and M=0) it has.
    
    (b)
        Page 2 will be replace because it is the earliest loaded page(first in-->first out).

    (c)
        Page 1 will be replaced because it has the oldest last referenced time(least recently referenced among these pages)

    (d)
        *The Second Chance Page Replacement Algorithm:
            Similar to FIFO algorithm but have to consider R bit at the same time.
            (1) if R=0,the page is both old and unused,so it is replaced immediately.
            (2) if R=1,the bit is cleared,the page put into the end of the list of pages,and its load time is updated as though it had just arrived in memory.
        
        -->Page 0 will be replaced because it is the earliest loaded page with R bit is 0.
           (Page 2 is the earliest loaded page but its R bit is 1-->put into the end of the list of page.)
2.
    --> Page D will be replaced because it is the earliest-loaded page among the pages that having referenced bit = 0.

    * Physical address is the hardware address of physical memory.
    * Virtual address is the address viewed by program in order to (1) allow many programs to run at once (2) protected data from other program.
    * Virtual address space usually has different size with physical adress space,according to the way virtual address mapped to physical address.
    * Virtual address space and physical address space are independent,virtual address will be translate into physical by page table or TLB.

4.
    Clock Page Replacement Algorithm and the Second Chance Page Replacement Algorithm are essentially the same,
    the only different is that clock algorithm present the FIFO queue into the circular form.
    
    -->According the information above,clock algorithm and the second chance will always choose the same page to replace.
