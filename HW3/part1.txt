1.
    Momery-mapped I/O is a I/O methed that by reserving the specific memory space for I/O device,
    ranges of memory space are set aside and are mapped to the device registers,
    so the cpu instructions that used to access the memory can also be used to access devices.

2.
    Direct Memory Access is the way of accessing main memory control independent of CPU by DMA controller,
    it can avoid main cpu wasting time to feed data into a controller register one byte a time.

    Definition(by wikipedia):
        Subroutine:
                    Subroutine is a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit.
                    It may be defined within programs, or separately in libraries that can be used by many programs. 
                    In different programming languages, a subroutine may be called a routine, subprogram, function, method, or procedure.
        Coroutine:
                    Coroutines are computer program components that generalize subroutines for non-preemptive multitasking, 
                    by allowing execution to be suspended and resumed. 
                    Coroutines are well-suited for implementing familiar program components such as 
                    cooperative tasks, exceptions, event loops, iterators, infinite lists and pipes.

    Because when the user part of process invokes the kernel part,kernel part begin from the same place every time,
    in other word,it's more like a "Subroutine" to be used by many other programs.
